# LangAgents

A modular repository for experimenting with **LangChain**, **AI Agents**, and **Autonomous AI Workflows**. This hub includes practical implementations, educational mini-projects, and advanced prototypes to explore the full potential of LLMs as reasoning and decision-making systems.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

- 🧩 **LangChain Projects**: 
  - Prompt engineering pipelines
  - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Chain-of-Thought reasoning
  - LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) demos

- 🤖 **LLM Agents**:
  - Tool-using agents (ReAct, Toolformer)
  - Memory-based agents (AutoGPT, BabyAGI-style)
  - Multi-agent collaboration

- 🧠 **Autonomous Workflows**:
  - Planning, task decomposition, execution
  - Agent loop architectures
  - Agent + LangGraph examples (coming soon)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- `LangChain`
- `Python`
- `OpenAI / Cohere / HuggingFace`
- `FAISS / Chroma` for vector DBs
- `Streamlit / Gradio` for interfaces
- `Docker` for isolated builds (optional)

## 🚀 How to Run

Each project is self-contained. Navigate into any project folder and follow its individual `README.md`. In general:

```bash
cd projects/langchain-rag-basic
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
