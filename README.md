# 🚀 AgenticAI

A comprehensive multi-agent AI framework featuring specialized agents with guardrails, built for real-world automation tasks (e.g., resume analysis, sales outreach, word counting).

## ⚙️ Architecture Highlights

* **Agentic Orchestration**: Manager agents direct specialist agents as tools, enabling clear multi-step workflows.
* **Guardrails**: Input validation layers that prevent privacy violations and unsafe inputs.
* **Multi-LLM Integration**: Easily plug in different providers for redundancy and performance optimization.
* **Modular & Extendable**: Projects share reusable agent-building patterns, guardrail designs, and runner logic using `openai-agents`.
