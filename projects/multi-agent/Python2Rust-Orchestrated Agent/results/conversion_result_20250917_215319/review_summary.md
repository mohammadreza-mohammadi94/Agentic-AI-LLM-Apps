**Judge Model:** `qwen-3-coder-480b`

## Original Python Code

```python

import time

def mandelbrot(c, max_iter):
    z = 0
    n = 0
    while abs(z) <= 2 and n < max_iter:
        z = z*z + c
        n += 1
    return n

def compute_mandelbrot(width, height, max_iter):
    image = [[0] * width for _ in range(height)]
    for row in range(height):
        for col in range(width):
            c = complex(-2.0 + (col / width) * 3.0, -1.5 + (row / height) * 3.0)
            color = mandelbrot(c, max_iter)
            image[row][col] = color
    return image

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_time = time.time()
    
    WIDTH, HEIGHT = 80, 40
    MAX_ITER = 256
    
    image = compute_mandelbrot(WIDTH, HEIGHT, MAX_ITER)
    
    chars = ".,-~:;=!*#$@"
    for row in image:
        line = ""
        for val in row:
            if val == MAX_ITER:
                line += " "
            else:
                line += chars[val % len(chars)]
        print(line)
        
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"\nPython Execution Time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

## Judge's Review of Submissions

## Consolidated Review of Rust Mandelbrot Implementations

### 1. Llama 3.3 70B Versatile - **Rating: 3/10**

**Execution Result:** ❌ **Failed to compile** due to crate naming issues
**Performance:** ⚠️ Cannot be evaluated due to compilation failure
**Idiomatic Style:** ⚠️ Basic structure is reasonable but has several issues

**Critique:**
The code failed to compile because of an invalid crate name containing periods. This is a fundamental build system error that should have been caught. Beyond this critical flaw, the implementation has some Rust-specific issues:
- Using `chars().nth().unwrap()` for character indexing is inefficient and unsafe
- The complex number representation as a tuple is functional but less readable than a proper struct
- Missing documentation and some variable naming could be more descriptive

This submission demonstrates basic understanding of the algorithm but fails at the most fundamental level of producing compilable code.

### 2. OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B - **Rating: 9/10**

**Execution Result:** ✅ **Success** - Compiles and runs correctly, producing accurate output
**Performance:** ✅ **Excellent** - 0.0005 seconds execution time
**Idiomatic Style:** ✅ **Very good** - Clean, safe, and idiomatic Rust

**Critique:**
This is a high-quality implementation that successfully translates the Python code:
- **Correctness:** Perfect output matching the Python version
- **Performance:** Exceptional execution speed
- **Style:** Well-documented with clear comments explaining the mathematical optimizations
- **Safety:** Uses safe indexing with `&` references and proper bounds checking
- **Efficiency:** Pre-allocates vectors appropriately and uses `with_capacity` for strings
- **Rust idioms:** Proper use of iterators, references, and type consistency

Minor improvements could include using a more descriptive struct for complex numbers instead of separate f64 parameters, but this is a very solid implementation overall.

### 3. Llama 4 Maverick 17B 128E - **Rating: 8/10**

**Execution Result:** ✅ **Success** - Compiles and runs correctly, producing accurate output
**Performance:** ✅ **Good** - 0.0006 seconds execution time
**Idiomatic Style:** ✅ **Good** - Clean and idiomatic with some minor issues

**Critique:**
This submission shows strong Rust knowledge with a well-structured approach:
- **Correctness:** Accurate output matching the reference implementation
- **Performance:** Very good, slightly slower than the GPT version but still excellent
- **Design:** Properly implements a Complex struct with mathematical operations, making the code more readable and maintainable
- **Idiomatic Rust:** Good use of traits, iterators, and functional programming patterns
- **Type system:** Consistent use of appropriate types throughout

The main drawbacks are:
- The character indexing logic is more complex than necessary
- Slightly less efficient than the direct parameter approach due to struct overhead
- Could benefit from implementing `std::ops` traits for more natural syntax

### Final Rankings:
1. **OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B** - 9/10 (Best balance of correctness, performance, and idiomatic style)
2. **Llama 4 Maverick 17B 128E** - 8/10 (Excellent design with custom Complex type, good performance)
3. **Llama 3.3 70B Versatile** - 3/10 (Fundamental compilation error prevents execution)

The OpenAI submission wins by demonstrating the most practical approach - prioritizing performance and correctness while maintaining clean, readable code. The Llama 4 Maverick submission is also very good but trades some performance for better abstraction. The Llama 3.3 submission cannot be considered viable due to its compilation failure.
