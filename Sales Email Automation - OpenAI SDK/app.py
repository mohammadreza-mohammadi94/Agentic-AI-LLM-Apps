sales_email_automation.py

This script implements a hierarchical multi-agent system to automate the
process of drafting, refining, and sending sales emails. The system leverages
the openai-agents SDK to create a team of specialized AI agents that
collaborate under the direction of a manager agent.

Architecture Overview:
- A top-level "Sales Manager" agent orchestrates the entire workflow.
- Three specialist "Writer" agents generate email drafts with different personas.
- A sub-system "Email Manager" agent handles the final steps of formatting
  and sending the email, using its own team of specialist tools.

You are an email formatter and sender. Your process is strict and sequential:
1. First, you MUST use the `subject_writer` tool to write a subject for the email body you receive.
2. Then, you MUST use the `html_converter` tool to convert the text body to HTML.
3. Finally, you MUST use the `send_html_email` tool to send the email with the generated subject and HTML body.
"""

SALES_MANAGER_INSTRUCTIONS = """
You are a sales manager at ComplAI. Your goal is to create and send the most effective cold sales email.
Your workflow is as follows:
1. You MUST use all three writer tools (professional_writer, engaging_writer, busy_writer) to generate three different versions of the email based on the user's request.
2. You MUST analyze the three versions and select the single best one based on your expert judgment of which email will be most effective.
3. Once you have chosen the best email body, you MUST handoff to the Email_Manager agent to handle the final formatting and sending.
